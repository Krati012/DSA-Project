Amongst  the  various  data  analysis  techniques  under  the  unsupervised  learning  domain,  clustering is  one  of  the  most  common  exploratory  approach  used  to  get  an  intuition  about  the  structure  of  the data.  It can be defined as the task of identifying homogeneous subgroups/substructure within the dataspace such that data points in each cluster are as similar as possible according to an application specific similarity measure such as euclidean-based distance, correlation-based distance, etc.  Much efforts have been put in by the various communities to further enhance the performance and computational efficiency of the clustering analysis given its prospects and applications.  In this work, we present the use of one of the clustering algorithms/methods known as K-means clustering, its applications in the task of image compression and discuss in brief about the evaluation metric for this algorithm and drawbacks of thesame.
